/**
 * A proof of concept stager. This downloads a payload from a URL Compiles it in
 * memory and then executes a method in that payload. I was inspired by this
 * talk by James Williams:
 *
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=247m2dwLlO4
 *
 * Who said try it in Java.
 *
 * Based on this PDF:
 *
 * http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/javaArt1/onTheFlyArt1.pdf
 *
 * I found the best solution would be to use "Janino". This gets
 * around these requirements:
 *
 * 1) That the victim must have JDK installed (unlikely for most users)
 * 2) That the victim has permissions to write to "JRE/lib" folder
 *
 * The solution to 1) was to copy a version of JDK's "tools.jar" to JRE/lib.
 * This introduced licensing issues as well as privileges for 2).
 *
 * Instead using Janino means we can integrate "janino.jar" into the lib folder
 * and have a functional Java compiler. Janino lives here:
 *
 * http://janino-compiler.github.io/janino/
 *
 * Bypassing AntiVirus is likely but I just wanted to replicate some of the
 * interesting steps in Java.
